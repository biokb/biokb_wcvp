## The World Checklist of Vascular Plants, a continuously updated resource for exploring global plant diversity
[Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8363670/pdf/41597_2021_Article_997.pdf)

**Background & Purpose:**

The WCVP is a comprehensive, continuously updated list documenting global vascular plant diversity. It supports research, conservation, and policy-making by offering:

1. Scientifically reviewed plant taxonomies.
2. Open, transparent, and regularly updated information accessible globally.
3. Integration with major biodiversity databases like GBIF and Catalogue of Life.

The WCVP is built upon the nomenclatural data from the International Plant Names Index (IPNI) and incorporates expert-reviewed taxonomic data. It aims to provide a global consensus on plant species classification while remaining adaptable to new scientific developments.

**Data Model & Workflows:**

WCVP maintains a structured data model, leveraging relational databases for taxonomic and geographic data storage. The key workflows include:

A-Z Workflow:
Names are classified as accepted, synonyms, or unplaced based on scientific literature and expert opinions.

Family Review Workflow:
Experts review taxonomic data for specific plant families before public release.

Geographic Workflow:
Focuses on mapping global plant distribution using standard country codes.

Update Workflow:
Weekly updates incorporate new publications, user feedback, and IPNI data.

The system adheres to international taxonomic standards and practices, ensuring high data integrity and consistency.

**Rationale for Dataset Creation:**

The authors argue the importance of WCVP for:

1. Addressing challenges posed by previous static plant lists, such as incomplete or outdated data.
2. Providing transparency and traceability for taxonomic decisions.
3. Supporting conservation initiatives, biogeographic research, and policy development.
4. Offering a dynamic, expert-validated resource that incorporates community input and evolving taxonomic knowledge.

## Mapping Asia Plants: Plant Diversity and a Checklist of Vascular Plants in Indonesia
[Link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11360604/pdf/plants-13-02281.pdf)

**Background & Purpose:**

This paper addresses the underrepresentation of Southeast Asia in global plant inventories by compiling a comprehensive checklist of Indonesian vascular plants. It highlights Indonesia's status as a megadiverse country and underscores the importance of such checklists for biodiversity research and conservation.

**Key Contributions:**

1. Documenting 30,466 native vascular plant species across major regions such as Sumatra, Indonesian New Guinea, and Java.
2. Identifying patterns of endemism with high concentrations in Indonesian New Guinea.
3. Classifying species into distinct phytogeographical zones: Sunda Shelf, Sahul Shelf, and Wallacea.

**Data Compilation & Methodology:**

Data were gathered from literature and online sources, and rigorous taxonomy validation was performed using resources like the World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) and the Leipzig Catalogue of Vascular Plants.

**Relevance to WCVP:**

1. Provides detailed regional biodiversity data, complementing WCVP’s global scope.
2. Uses WCVP to validate plant species names and taxonomic classifications, enhancing data reliability.

**The authors argue the importance for:**

1. Comprehensive Plant Inventories: Addressing the lack of detailed plant diversity records for Indonesia, a biodiversity hotspot, to guide conservation strategies.
2. Conservation Efforts: Highlighting endemic species and regions needing priority protection.
3. Filling Regional Knowledge Gaps: Providing valuable regional data to global plant databases like WCVP to support biodiversity research and biogeographic analyses.
4. International Collaboration: Encouraging digitization and cross-border cooperation to maintain updated floristic information.

**Data Collection AND Techniques:**

1. Information was gathered from scientific databases like PubMed and Web of Science.
2. Chemical structures were drawn using ChemDraw.
3. PRISMA guidelines were followed for data selection.
4. Key compounds like terpenoids, flavonoids, and organic acids were identified across Celtis species.

**Relevance to WCVP:**

1. Utilizes WCVP for accurate taxonomic identification and plant species validation.
2. Enhances biodiversity understanding by linking phytochemical properties to specific plant taxa.

**The authors argue the importance for:**

1. Ethnopharmacological Documentation: Preserving traditional knowledge about the therapeutic uses of Celtis species.
2. Phytochemical Research: Identifying bioactive compounds for potential drug discovery to address emerging health challenges, including antimicrobial resistance.
3. Pharmacological Validation: Conducting rigorous clinical trials to verify and expand the therapeutic applications of Celtis-based treatments.
4. Biodiversity and Conservation: Protecting and sustainably utilizing Celtis species as valuable botanical resources for medicine and biodiversity conservation.
